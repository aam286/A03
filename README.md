* **Clone**: User can get a local copy of the remote repository using `git clone` command. "`git clone repositoryURLhere`
* **Commit**: This command can save any changes to the document later which will be pushed to the repository. Using `git commit`, the editor will take a snapshot of the most recent edition of the document.
